# task_scheduler
A simple task scheduler developed in C++

## Scope
I wanted to create this project because I had an exam about this topic and I understood I wasn't quite proficient with it.
Since parallel/cuncurrent programming is a topic that interests me a lot, I would like to learn as much as I can.
During the exam an implementation of the C++ TaskScheduler class was presented to me in a buggy implementation, and the
examiner asked me to find the errors and solve them. I found some of them but not enough, and he taught me some very interesting things.
This project contains what I learnt.
